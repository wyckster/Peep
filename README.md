# Peep

An image viewing utility.

My favourite features:
- The image will update when changes to the file are detected.
- A sample .reg file is included to perform Shell integration (so you can right-click on a file and say "Peep" to view it.)
- Nicely zoom in or out on the Image with the scroll wheel.
- View settings (pan/zoom, etc.) are remembered even after the image updates.

# Controls

- <kbd>0</kbd> _(the digit zero)_ Resets the view so that the image fits the window frame.
- <kbd>1</kbd> _(the digit one)_ Scales the image 1:1 so that image pixels match screen pixels. (Useful if you're having gamma issues.)
